## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(plotly)
ggpenguins <- qplot(bill_length_mm , body_mass_g, 
data = palmerpenguins::penguins, color = species)
ggplotly(ggpenguins)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(canada.cities, package = "maps")
# Objects: I'm storing the ggplot figure into viz
viz <- ggplot(canada.cities, aes(long, lat)) +
    borders(regions = "canada") +
    coord_equal() +
    geom_point(aes(text = name, size = pop), colour = "red", alpha = 1/2) +
  labs(size = "Population", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitute")
ggplotly(viz)
```
